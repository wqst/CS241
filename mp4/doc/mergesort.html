    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Recently, you have learned about the POSIX thread library, <b> pthread </b>, which allows a user to setup and run multiple threads of execution within
        a single process.  In this MP, you will program a basic multithreaded merge sort algorithm using pthreads.
    </p>

    <p>
        To help you with input data sets, we have provided a program that will generate random numbers within a sequence.  Running the command 
        <tt>./gen --min 0 --max 50 --seed 0 25</tt> on EWS will always generate the same data set, printed below:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        10 49 9 34 32 37 37 48 45 19 5 31 20 19 29 22 45 30 40 31 35 8 36 39 14
    </blockquote>
    <br />

    <p>
        As input to this MP, you will be given a <b> single command line argument</b>: the number of times that the data should be split up as 
        part of the merge sort.  For example, a <b><tt>segment_count</tt> of 5 </b>indicates that the data should be split into 5 (roughly) equal-sized
        segments.  If we consider running the MP with the above generated sequence and a <b><tt>segment_count</tt> of 5</b>, the data will be split as below:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <u>Split #1</u><br />
                <tt>10 49 9 34 32</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #2</u><br />
                <tt>37 37 48 45 19</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #3</u><br />
                <tt>5 31 20 19 29</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #4</u><br />
                <tt>22 45 30 40 31</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #5</u><br />
                <tt>35 8 36 39 14</tt>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />

    <p>
        <b>The first part of the merge sort requires you to sort each individual sort, in parallel.</b>  In our example, this means that
        you will launch five threads -- one for each of the splits -- and each thread must sort only their segment of the input.
        (You don't have to write your own sort here; in fact, you must use the C command <tt>qsort()</tt>.)
    </p>

    <p>
        After the sort threads have all completed, the data will look like:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <u>Split #1</u><br />
                <tt>9 10 32 34 49</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #2</u><br />
                <tt>19 37 37 45 48</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #3</u><br />
                <tt>5 19 20 29 31</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #4</u><br />
                <tt>22 30 31 40 45</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #5</u><br />
                <tt>8 14 35 36 39</tt>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />


    <p>
        <b>Next, the merge sort will take adjoining pairs of splits and merge them together, in parallel.</b>  This will be done in rounds,
        where each round a number of parallel merges take place until there is only a single, completely sorted list remaining.
        (Remember, merging is an O(n) operation <b>NOT</b> O(n*lg(n))... so you shouldn't call <tt>qsort()</tt> here.)
    </p>

    <p>
        In our example, the first round of merging consists of two parallel merges: (Split #1 and Split #2) and (Split #3 and Split #4).
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">
                <u>Split #(1+2)</u><br />
                <tt>9 10 19 32 34 37 37 45 48 49</tt>
            </td>
            <td colspan="2">
                <u>Split #(3+4)</u><br />
                <tt>5 19 20 22 29 30 31 31 40 45</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #5</u><br />
                <tt>8 14 35 36 39</tt>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />


    <p>
        The second round of merging consists of only one merge:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="4">
                <u>Split #(1+2+3+4)</u><br />
                <tt>5 9 10 19 19 20 22 29 30 31 31 32 34 37 37 40 45 45 48 49</tt>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>Split #5</u><br />
                <tt>8 14 35 36 39</tt>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />


    <p>
        And the final round also only consists of one merge:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="5">
                <u>Split #(1+2+3+4+5)</u><br />
                <tt>5 8 9 10 14 19 19 20 22 29 30 31 31 32 34 35 36 37 37 39 40 45 45 48 49</tt>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br />


    <p>
        <i>In this MP, you must always start with the &quot;left most&quot; split and merge it with its neighbor.</i>  As such, the
        &quot;right most&quot; split will often be the last to be merged in.  To let us know what you're doing, you will be required
        to output a few different print statements.  For this example, the output of the program would actually look like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    Sorted 5 elements.<br />
    Sorted 5 elements.<br />
    Sorted 5 elements.<br />
    Sorted 5 elements.<br />
    Sorted 5 elements.<br />
    Merged 5 and 5 elements with 0 duplicates.<br />
    Merged 5 and 5 elements with 1 duplicates.<br />
    Merged 10 and 10 elements with 2 duplicates.<br />
    Merged 20 and 5 elements with 0 duplicates.<br />
    5<br />
    8<br />
    9<br />
    [...]
    </blockquote>
    (See the complete output at the bottom of this document.)


    <h2>Tasks</h2>

    You are given an empty program, <tt>msort.c</tt>, where all the code for this MP should be contained.  To complete this MP, you will need to do
    the following tasks:


    <h4>[Task 1]</h4>
    Read the sequence of input numbers from <tt>stdin</tt>.  There will be one number per line, in the exact format that is outputted by <tt>./gen</tt>.<br />
    <br />
    
    <h4>[Task 2]</h4>
    Find the number of segments, <tt>segment_count</tt> from above, by reading the command-line argument of <tt>./msort</tt>.  For example, if <tt>segment_count</tt> is
    12, the command line will be <tt>./msort 12</tt>.<br />
    <br />

    <h4>[Task 3]</h4>
    <p>
        Divide up the input into <tt>segment_count</tt> segments such that each segment is equal-sized (eg: 25 input numbers / 5 segments = 5 numbers / segment).  If
        you are unable to achieve equal-sized segments, you should ensure that the first (<tt>segment_count - 1</tt>) segments are equal sized and the last segment
        is smaller than the first (<tt>segment_count - 1</tt>) segments.<br />
        <br />
        If you have <tt>input_ct</tt> input numbers and <tt>segment_count</tt> segments, you can find the size of each of the first <tt>segment_count - 1</tt> segments
        with the following line:
    </p>
       
    <blockquote>
        int values_per_segment; /**&lt; Maximum number of values per segment. */<br />
        <br />
        if (input_ct % segment_count == 0)<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;values_per_segment = input_ct / segment_count;<br />
        else<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;values_per_segment = (input_ct / segment_count) + 1;<br />
    </blockquote>
    <br />


    <h4>[Task 4]</h4>
    <p>
        Launch one thread per segment to sort each segment using <tt>qsort()</tt>.  Your program must block until all threads finish sorting.<br />
        <br />
        After the threads finish the <tt>qsort()</tt> operation, you should print out a status line indicating the number of lines sorted.
        This should be printed in your sorter function, printed to <tt>stderr</tt>, and printed as the exact format shown below:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Sorted %d elements.\n&quot;, count);
    </blockquote>
    <br />


    <h4>[Task 5]</h4>
    <p>
        Launch several rounds of threads to merge the sorted data segments.  Each round must block until all threads in the current round finishes
        before advancing.<br />
        <br />
        The threads must be merged in a specific order, where the segment at the beginning of the data set is merged with the next segment in the
        data set.  That is <tt>segment[0]</tt> must be merged with <tt>segment[1]</tt>.  This pattern should follow such that <tt>segment[i]</tt>
        is merged with <tt>segment[i + 1]</tt> for all even values of <tt>i</tt>.  If there is an odd number of segments, you should not merge
        the left over segment in the current round (simply advance it to the next round of merging).<br />
        <br />
        After each round, you will have <tt>(ct / 2)</tt> or <tt>(ct / 2) + 1</tt> segments remaining, where <tt>ct</tt> it the number of segments
        you had in the previous round.  You must continue the merging process until only 1 segment remains.<br />
        <br />
        In merge sort, the merge operation <b>MUST NOT</b> be an O(n * lg(n)) operation.  Instead, think of how you can merge two sorted lists
        in O(n) time.  While merging the two lists, you must also keep track of how many duplicates you've seen between the two lists.  (You
        should count a duplicate <b>ONLY</b> when you find the same number in both lists -- not if your list contains the same number multiple
        times.  Count each time you see a duplicate number in both lists, even if that means the same number is counted multiple times.)<br />
        <br />
        When the merging has completed, the merging thread should print out a status line.  As with the sorted thread, this line should be
        printed to <tt>stderr</tt>, printed in your merge function, and printed in the exact format shown below:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
	    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Merged %d and %d elements with %d duplicates.\n&quot;, count1, count2, dupes);
    </blockquote>
    <br />


    <h4>[Task 6]</h4>
    <p>
        Once you have a single sorted list, print out the list, one number per line, to <tt>stdout</tt>.  This can be done by <tt>printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, value);</tt>.
    </p>
    <br />


    <h2>Compile and Run</h2>

    As always, compile using:
    <blockquote>
        $ make clean<br />
        $ make
    </blockquote>

    To run this program, you will need to generate input data using <tt>./gen</tt>.  You can use <tt>./gen</tt> to generate a random set of numbers by using, for example:
    <blockquote>
        ./gen 100 &gt;file.txt
    </blockquote>
    ...to generate 100 numbers.<br />
    <br />

    You can also use <tt>./gen</tt> to generate numbers within a range.  For example:
    <blockquote>
        ./gen --min 0 --max 100 100 &gt;file.txt
    </blockquote>
    ...will generate 100 random numbers in the range of [0, 100].  Since the numbers are random, there will almost certainly be duplicates.<br />
    <br />

    You can specify a specific random sequence by supplying a seed.  The data set that was generated for the introduction of this MP was done by:
    <blockquote>
        ./gen --min 0 --max 50 --seed 0 25 &gt;example1.txt
    </blockquote>
    ...when running on an EWS machine.<br />
    <br />

    To run your program with a given input, supply the number of segments and the input file:
    <blockquote>
        ./msort 5 &lt;example1.txt
    </blockquote>
    
    If you generated the same <tt>example1.txt</tt> as we did, the full output of the command above should be:
    <blockquote>
        Sorted 5 elements.<br />
        Sorted 5 elements.<br />
        Sorted 5 elements.<br />

        31<br />
        31<br />

        45<br />
        48<br />
        49
    </blockquote>

    
    You should make sure to test your MP with large data sets as well.  As an example, <tt>example2.txt</tt> can be generated by:
    <blockquote>
        ./gen --min 0 --max 1234567 --seed 0 1234567 &gt;example2.txt
    </blockquote>

    Since you will sorting over a million lines, it may be useful to write the sorted output to a file (instead of showing it
    to the user).  Running your MP with the <tt>exmaple2.txt</tt> dataset:
    <blockquote>
        ./msort 9 &lt;example2.txt &gt;example2-sorted.txt
    </blockquote>

    ...should result in the following output:
    <blockquote>
        Sorted 137175 elements.<br />
        Sorted 137175 elements.<br />
        Sorted 137175 elements.<br />

        Merged 137175 and 137175 elements with 14308 duplicates.<br />
        Merged 137175 and 137175 elements with 14284 duplicates.<br />
        Merged 274350 and 274350 elements with 54702 duplicates.<br />

        Merged 548700 and 548700 elements with 197491 duplicates.<br />
        Merged 1097400 and 137167 elements with 115132 duplicates.
    </blockquote>
    <br />


    Finally, since we're using threads, we should see a speedup between using a single segment (where all the work is done by a single thread)
    and using many segments.  This should be most clear in really large test cases, so we will generate a third example:
    <blockquote>
        ./gen --min 0 --max 12346578 --seed 0 12346578 &gt;example3.txt
    </blockquote>

    
    We can test the time our program takes to run by using the Linux <tt>time</tt> command.<br />
    <br />
    With one large segment:
    <blockquote>
        $ time ./msort 1 &lt;example3.txt &gt;/dev/null<br />
        Sorted 12345678 elements.<br />
        <br />
        <b>real    0m7.955s</b><br />
        user    0m7.879s<br />
        sys     0m0.069s<br />
    </blockquote>
    With eight smaller segments:
    <blockquote>
        $ time ./msort 8 &lt;example3.txt &gt;/dev/null<br />
        Sorted 1543210 elements.<br />
