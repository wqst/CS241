    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        These problems are designed to help familiarize you with the C standard library functions
        for manipulating strings.  These functions differ from those you have seen in C++, unlike 
        std::string in C++, strings in C are merely NULL-terminated byte arrays.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second part of this task is to construct a list of integers that supports some basic
        operations including insert, average, min, max, and clear.  The point of this part of the
        assignment is to familiarize you with the way that many datastructures are implemented in
        C.  It should be very useful as you work on MP1.

        Finally, there is a file containing additional standard library functions that you can try
        to implement in your spare time.  They are also tested by part1-test.c and they are more
        difficult than those found in part1.c.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>
        To begin working on this project you first make the project use the make command.  This will 
        create three executables, part1, part1-std, and part2.  The part1 executable is compiled using
        the functions implemented in part1.c, and part1-extra.c, and the unit tests in part1-test.c.
        Initially the executable will run and indicate that most of the unit test have failed, it is
        your task to modify part1.c (and optionally part1-extra.c) to properly implement the string functions
        called from part1-test.c (you are encouraged to look at this file too).  As an example of a
        fully functional implementation you may run part1-std, it contains the part1-test.c file compiled
        against the C standard library string functions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second part of the assignment compiles to part2 and contains the datastructure implemented
        in part2.c and part2.h, the tests for this datastructure that execute when you run part2 are
        found in part2-test.c.  You should pay careful attention to this file as it is an excellent
        example of how good tests are written and should be of some guidance when crafting tests for
        MP1.
    </p>

    <h2>Compile and Run</h2>

    To compile these programs, run:
    <blockquote>
        make clean<br />
        make
    </blockquote>

    To run your own implementation (ds1.c):
    <blockquote>
      ./part1
      ./part2
    </blockquote>

    To run the standard library implementation:
    <blockquote>
      ./part1-std
    </blockquote>
