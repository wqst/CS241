        You will be using <tt>fork()</tt> in this MP.  You should understand what it means to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bomb</a>.<br />
        <br />
        If you fork bomb the nightly autograder, you will be excluded from all future nightly autograders for this MP.  You will be notified of this.<br />
        If you fork bomb the final autograder, you will get a 0 for this MP. No exceptions!<br />
        Once a fork bomb is detected, the autograder and all the other processes die.  So nightly autograders may not always get out overnight.<br />
        <br />
        <b>Make sure to always run all five testers before committing your code.</b>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In 2004, Google developed a general framework for processing large data sets on clusters of computers.  We recommend you read the link
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce on Wikipedia</a> for some background information. However, we will explain everything you need to know below.
    </p>

    <p>
        To explain what MapReduce does, we'll use a small dataset (the first few lines of a famous poem by Robert Frost):

        <blockquote>
	        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
	        And sorry I could not travel both<br />
	        And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
	        And looked down one as far as I could.
        </blockquote>
        <br />
        <br />

        To run MapReduce, we first split the dataset into small pieces.  For this example, we will split the dataset by the four lines of the poem:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #1</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"
                </td>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #2</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "And sorry I could not travel both"
                </td>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #3</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "And be one traveler, long I stood"
                </td>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #4</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "And looked down one as far as I could."
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <br />
        
        As part of the input to any MapReduce program, a user will provide a <tt>map()</tt> function.  This function will map the input into a
        series of <tt>(key, value)</tt> pairs.  For this example, let the <tt>map()</tt> function simply count the number of each letter (a-z) in the
        data set.<br />
        <br />

        This MapReduce algorithm will spawn <b>1 process per data set</b> and run the <tt>map()</tt> function on each dataset:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #1</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"<br />
                    pid = 1001<br />
                    <tt>map()</tt> <b>Output</b>: a: 2, b: 0, c: 0, d: 4, e: 3, f: 0, g: 1, h: 0, i: 2, j: 0, k: 0, l: 2, m: 0, n: 1, o: 5, p: 0, q: 0, r: 2, s: 1, t: 1, u: 0, v: 1, w: 3, x: 0, y: 1, z: 0
                </td>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #2</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "And sorry I could not travel both"<br />
                    pid = 1002<br />
                    <tt>map()</tt> <b>Output</b>: a: 2, b: 1, c: 1, d: 2, e: 1, f: 0, g: 0, h: 1, i: 1, j: 0, k: 0, l: 2, m: 0, n: 2, o: 4, p: 0, q: 0, r: 3, s: 1, t: 3, u: 1, v: 1, w: 0, x: 0, y: 1, z: 0
                </td>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #3</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "And be one traveler, long I stood"<br />
                    pid = 1003<br />

                </td>
                <td>
                    <u>Data Set #4</u><br />
                    <b>Input</b>: "And looked down one as far as I could."<br />
                    pid = 1004<br />
                    <tt>map()</tt> <b> Output</b>: a: 4, b: 0, c: 1, d: 4, e: 2, f: 1, g: 0, h: 0, i: 1, j: 0, k: 1, l: 2, m: 0, n: 3, o: 5, p: 0, q: 0, r: 1, s: 2, t: 0, u: 1, v: 0, w: 1, x: 0, y: 0, z: 0
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <br />
        
        The <tt>map()</tt> processes produce its output.  And those output is the initial input of the <tt>reduce()</tt> fucntion.  By using MapReduce Algorithm, the <tt>reduce()</tt> function then collects and combine the output of each process to form a single
        data set to return to the user.  The output of <tt>reduce()</tt> should be a collection of values in the same domain of its input.  In particular, for this example, the <tt>reduce()</tt> function is called every time the same key is seen from two different processes.  And
        our reduce function will simply add the values of the two keys (eg: <tt>a: 2</tt> and <tt>a: 4</tt> will result in <tt>a: 6</tt>).<br />
        <br />

        All <tt>reduce()</tt> calls are run in a single worker thread, within the process that called the MapReduce framework initially.  The <tt>reduce()</tt> calls are not performed in a new or recycled <tt>map()</tt> process.
        Adding to our diagram:

	For each unique key, <tt>reduce()</tt> will be called multiple times, until the multiple values outputted from the <tt>map()</tt>s are reduced down into a single value for that key.  As an example, consider the key 'a'.  The way the <tt>reduce()</tt> functions is called might depend on the timing of when the processes finish, but one possible sequence of operations is shown in the diagram below.  (<u>This depicts what happens only for the key 'a'; the other keys would be similar.</u>)<br />

		<td>
			<img src="reduce.jpg" width="400" height="400" />
		</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

<br />
	In this MP, you will be provided the data sets (already split up for you) and several example <tt>map()</tt> and <tt>reduce()</tt> functions. You will need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Create the <tt>map()</tt> processes. <i>System call: fork()</i></li>
            <li>Read the result of the <tt>map()</tt> processes over a pipe or fifo. <i>System call: pipe() or fifo()</i></li>
            <li>Process the results of each process using only a single thread, by using I/O multiplexing. <i>System call: epoll()</i></li>
            <li>Give the current set of completed results back to the user at any time, even if some of the <tt>map()</tt> processes are not yet finished.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br />


    <h2>The MP</h2>

    <h4>What we provide for you:</h4>
    <p>
        Besides the tester programs, we provide you a data store <tt>libds</tt> that allows you to store the results of your MapReduce.
        <tt>libds</tt> includes <tt>_get()</tt>, <tt>_put()</tt>, <tt>_update()</tt>, and <tt>_delete()</tt> operations that work
        similarly to the dictionary you built in MP1.  However, these functions provide revision numbers to each key.  When you update
        or delete a key, you are required to provide the latest revision number you know about.  If the revision number does not match
        what is in the data store, the update or delete operation will notify you that it could not complete the operation because the
        data your program knew about is out of date.
        <a href="libds_8c.html">You can find the full API to <tt>libds</tt> here.</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        You will find we also provide a <tt>read_from_fd()</tt> helper function, which we will explain later in this file.
    </p>


    <h4>What you must do for this MP:</h4>

    <h4>[Part 1]</h4>

    This MP is divided into two parts.  First, you must complete the five core functions that make up <tt>libmapreduce</tt>:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>mapreduce_init()</b>
            <blockquote>
                void mapreduce_init(mapreduce_t *mr,<br />
	            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void (*mymap)(int, const char *),<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const char *(*myreduce)(const char *, const char *));            
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This function will be the first call made to the <tt>libmapreduce</tt> library.  You should put any initialization logic here.
                (<i>You will likely want to store the <tt>mymap</tt> and <tt>myreduce</tt> functions inside <tt>mr</tt> for later use; <tt>mapreduce_init()</tt> should not call either of these functions.</i>)<br />
                <br />
                <br />

                The <tt>mymap</tt> function pointer is a pointer to a function of the following format:
                <blockquote>
                void map(int fd, const char *data)
                </blockquote>
                ...where <tt>fd</tt> is the file descriptor to which <tt>map()</tt> will write the results of the <tt>map()</tt> operation on the dataset <tt>data</tt>.  The
                <tt>map()</tt> function will always write the <tt>(key, value)</tt> result to <tt>fd</tt> in the format <tt>key: value\n</tt>.  As a <tt>printf()</tt>,
                this would be:
                <blockquote>
                    printf("%s: %s\n", key, value);
                </blockquote>
                <b>You do not need to write <tt>mymap()</tt>, it is passed in as a function pointer to <tt>mapreduce_init()</tt>.</b>  You should note that <tt>map()</tt> will always close the fd passed to it before returning.<br />
                <br />
                <br />

                <tt>myreduce</tt> is a pointer to a function of the following format:
                <blockquote>
                const char *reduce(const char *value1, const char *value2)
                </blockquote>
                ...where <tt>reduce()</tt> will return <b>a newly <tt>malloc()</tt>'d region of memory</b> that is the "reduction" of <tt>value1</tt> and <tt>value2</tt>.
                Since this function will <tt>malloc()</tt> new memory, you will need to <tt>free()</tt> this memory at some later point.<br />
                <br />
                <b>You do not need to write <tt>myreduce</tt>, it is passed in as a function pointer to <tt>mapreduce_init()</tt>.</b><br />
            </p>
            <br />
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>mapreduce_map_all()</b>
            <blockquote>void mapreduce_map_all(mapreduce_t *mr, const char **values);</blockquote>

            <p>
                This is the main function of the first part of this MP. <b>This function will only be called once.</b><br />
                <br />
                As input to this function, <tt>values</tt> contains a NULL-terminated array of C-strings.  (If there are three values, <tt>values[0]</tt>,
                <tt>values[1]</tt>, <tt>values[2]</tt> will point to C-strings of the data sets each of your <tt>map()</tt> processes should use and
                <tt>value[3]</tt> will be equal to <tt>NULL</tt>.)  Each of the strings in <tt>values</tt> will be one data set.<br />
                <br />

                In this function, you must launch <b>one process per data set</b>, and one worker thread (<b>the worker is a thread within the process that called mapreduce_map_all()</b>).  Each new process will call <tt>map()</tt> on one data set.  The worker thread will use multiple calls to <tt>reduce()</tt> to process the data coming back from the <tt>map()</tt> processes you have launched.<br />
                <br />
                In the description of the <tt>map()</tt> function, you saw that you will need to pass a file descriptor <tt>fd</tt> into <tt>map()</tt>.  This
                file descriptor should be the writing side of a pipe or fifo that you create in this function.  Once <tt>fork()</tt>'d and the pipe has been
                set up, the child process should need to only run code similar to the following:
                <blockquote>
                {<br />
                &nbsp; /* child */<br />
                &nbsp; map(fd, values[i]);<br />
                &nbsp; exit(0);   /* exit the child process */<br />
                }<br />
                </blockquote>
                <br />
                Since <tt>mapreduce_map_all()</tt> is only called once, you may find it easier to launch all the processes, set up all the pipes, and then launch the <b>one worker
                thread</b> that will be reading the <tt>map()</tt> results from each of the child processes.  Since you have only a single thread, and <b>must</b>
                read results as soon as they're available, you are unable to simply make a blocking <tt>read()</tt> call.<br />
                <br />
                Instead, you must use <tt>epoll()</tt> to query which of the file descriptors are ready to be read without blocking.  Since
                you are reading from <tt>N</tt> different streams, it may be useful to create <tt>N</tt> buffers (one for each process).  If you create one
                buffer per process, we have provided a helper function for to assist with reading the results of the <tt>map()</tt> processes:
                <blockquote>
                int read_from_fd(int fd, char *buffer, mapreduce_t *mr)
                </blockquote>
                ...this function will <tt>read()</tt> data from <tt>fd</tt> and make a call to <tt>process_key_value()</tt> for each <tt>(key, value)</tt>
                that was read.  If a line was only partially read, this function will leave the un-processed data in <tt>buffer</tt> and expects it
                to be read the next time the function is called.  This function expects <tt>buffer</tt> to initially be of size <tt>BUFFER_SIZE + 1</tt> and
                for <tt>buffer[0] == '\0'</tt>.  Finally, the <tt>mr</tt> pointer is simply passed-through to <tt>process_key_value()</tt> as it
                may be useful to you, as you will need to write the logic to process the key and the value.<br />
                <br />
                A call to <tt>read_from_fd()</tt> may look like <tt>read_from_fd(fds[i], buffer[i], mr)</tt>.  The return value of <tt>read_from_fd()</tt>
                will be <tt>1</tt> if data was successfully read.  You'll notice that this function will
                blindly attempt to <tt>read()</tt> from the <tt>fd</tt>.  <b>It's up to you to only call this function if data is available to be <tt>read()</tt>.</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Regardless of whether you choose to use <tt>read_from_fd()</tt> or write your own function, each time a <tt>(key, value)</tt> pair is received, it must be updated
                in your internal data structure.</u>  If the <tt>(key, value)</tt> contains a key you have never seen before, this <tt>(key, value)</tt> should
                be stored.  If the <tt>(key, value)</tt> contains a key already stored, you must call <tt>reduce()</tt> on the stored value and the newly read
                value and then update the value of <tt>key</tt> to the value returned by <tt>reduce()</tt>.<br />
                <br />
               <tt>mapreduce_map_all()</tt> <b>MUST NOT</b> block waiting for the thread or processes to finish.  In other words, typically,<tt>mapreduce_map_all()</tt> will return before the child processes and the worker thread have completed.
            </p>
            <br />

        <li>
            <b>mapreduce_reduce_all()</b>
            <blockquote>void mapreduce_reduce_all(mapreduce_t *mr)</blockquote>

            <p>
                <b>This function will always be called only once</b>, and will always be called sometime after <tt>mapreduce_map_all()</tt> is called.<br />
                <br />
                This function should block until all <tt>map()</tt>'ing and <tt>reduce()</tt>'ing has completed.

            <p>
                This function should return the current value of <tt>result_key</tt>.  If the <tt>result_key</tt> does not exist, return <tt>NULL</tt>.
                If a string is returned, it should be a newly allocated string that will need to be freed by the caller.
                This function may be called at any time, including while the <tt>map()</tt> processes are working
                (<i>as more <tt>map()</tt>'s finish, the <tt>value</tt> for the same <tt>key</tt> will likely change between calls to this function).</i>

    <h4>[Part 2]</h4>
	
	Secondly, you must complete the <tt>map()</tt> and <tt>reduce()</tt> functions for <tt>test6.c</tt>, which aims to find the longest word in the entire text of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i></tt>:
     <ul>
        <li>
            <b>map()</b>
            <blockquote>void map(int fd, const char *data)</blockquote>

			<p>This function should take input from <tt>char *data</tt> and then  map the longest word to the key: <tt>long_key</tt>.  Finally, it should write the <tt>key: value</tt> pair into the file with the form of  <tt>long_key: XXXXXXXXX</tt>.  A word is defined as a contiguous block of alphabetic characters ([a-zA-Z]+).  You can use the function <tt>isalpha()</tt> to test a single character.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>reduce()</b>
            <blockquote>const char *reduce(const char *value1, const char *value2)</blockquote>

            <p>This function should take two words and reduce to the longer of the two.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    For the second part, the test cases that we have provided are good examples for you to follow, especially <tt>test4.c</tt>

    <h2>Compile and Run</h2>

    As always, compile using:
    <blockquote>
        make clean<br />
        make
    </blockquote>

    We provide five test cases:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>test1</tt>: One dataset and nothing to <tt>reduce()</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>test2</tt>: Two datasets with only one key, resulting in one <tt>reduce()</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>test3</tt>: A tester that runs the example in the beginning of this file (first four lines of Robert Frost's poem).
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>test4</tt>: A tester running MapReduce on the entire text of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>test5</tt>: A tester testing if calls to <tt>mapreduce_get_value()</tt> update as <tt>map()</tt> processes finish at different times.
        </li>
    </ul>
 <i>(NOTE: ./test5 may be slightly different depending on how you create your IPC mechanism.)</i><br><br>

    <h2>Grading</h2>

    <p>
        For <tt>valgrind</tt> memory grading, we will only be testing if your program cleaned up all memory in your original, parent
        process.  You should run:
        <blockquote>
            valgrind --child-silent-after-fork=yes --leak-check=full ./test#
        </blockquote>
        ...when running your valgrind tests.<br />
        <br />
        <b><u>Finally, remember that big red warning at the top of this page.    </u></b>
